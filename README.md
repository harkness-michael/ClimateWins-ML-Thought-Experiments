# ClimateWins-ML-Thought-Experiments
## Project Overview:
This project explores advanced machine learning techniques to help ClimateWins, a nonprofit organization, predict the consequences of climate change and address critical challenges. 
The goal is to analyze historical weather data, identify patterns and anomalies, and model future scenarios for decision-making and long-term planning.

## Key Objectives:
Discover new weather patterns: Analyze 60 years of European weather data to identify trends and anomalies.

Predict extreme weather events: Develop models to anticipate floods, heatwaves, and storms with improved accuracy.

Model safe zones for habitation: Identify regions in Europe likely to remain habitable over the next 50 years.

## Machine Learning Techniques
This project employs various machine learning methods tailored for different aspects of the problem:

### 1. Unsupervised Learning
K-means clustering: Groups similar weather patterns to detect trends.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces data complexity, focusing on key trends.

Autoencoders: Identifies unusual weather patterns through deep learning.
### 2. Deep Learning for Prediction
LSTM Networks: Long-term time-series analysis for forecasting extreme events.

Random Forests: Analyzes feature importance for better understanding weather variability.

## Data Sources
### Historical Weather Data:
Collected from 18 weather stations across Europe (1800sâ€“2022) via the European Climate Assessment & Data Set (ECA&D).
Daily observations of temperature, wind speed, snow, and global radiation.

## Thought Experiments
